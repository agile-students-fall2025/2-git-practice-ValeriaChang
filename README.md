[Skills a Data Scientist Must Have (But a Software Engineer Doesnâ€™t)](https://towardsdatascience.com/software-engineering-to-data-science-a07f178a98c4/)


I am a computer science major minoring in data science so I found this article interesting because it highlighted the difference in mindsets between a software engineer and a data scientist. Software engineering emphasizes **structure and predictability**, while data science is more about **experimentation and flexibility** which could arguably be compared to the agile approach. 

I also liked the idea of the **80/20** rule in regards to skills. It made me realize that mastering a few key tools like Python and Pandas can go a long way, rather than trying to master everything at once.
